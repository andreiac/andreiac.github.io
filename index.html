    <p>I'm a lawyer by training and techy by passion. After working in criminal and corporate law, I decided it was time to move on to a new adventure. With that in mind, here I am on GitHub.  Before you ask, yes, my profile picture is me in my office, so sue me. #badlawyerjoke </p>
      <br>
      <p>My first goal? Turn my passion into a skill. (As  Charlie Brown said, "this is going to take more than one night.‚Äù) My ultimate goal? To combine both my present, and hopefully future, strengths and  create some damn good software for lawyers. Take a long around, check out my portfolio, and hit me up with any questions or comments you may have. I'll keep updating as I go along.</p>
